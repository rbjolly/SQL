# SQL
Sandbox for SQL scripts.

These examples were created long ago in order to teach others some basics of SQL.
I make no warranty on any code in this repo. Use at your own risk.

Included are examples for creating stored procedures and functions along with some basic SQL commands.
These exampes were developed back in the days of MySQL 5.
